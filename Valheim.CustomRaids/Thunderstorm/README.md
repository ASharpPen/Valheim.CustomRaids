This mod allows for customizing raids to your liking.

Want to have armies besieging your fortress? A bit of extra environmental effects along your way? Or just disable trolls?

This mod can help you do all of that!

Comes preconfigured with two additional end-game raids (disabled by default), to show how and what can be done.

Enable those raids at own risk.

# Features

- Can change frequency of raids
- Add new raid events, with full configuration options, including spawns
- Override existing raid (eg. disable trolls)
- Supplemental raid configurations. Add your own file, and Custom Raids will scan and apply it
- Potential for hours of frustration/fun as you figure out how to best configure these damn things to work as expected.

# Configuration

All configurations are placed in the default BepInEx configuration folder, and generated upon starting the game.

## General "custom_raids.cfg"

General configuration includes general mod controls, overall event system changes, and debugging options.

## Main raid file "custom_raids.raids.cfg"

Main file for adding raid configuration.

To add a raid you must:

1. Add a raid section with general event configuration

``` INI 
[YourRaidName]
Enabled=true
Name=MyRaid
... additional configuration
``` 

2. Add spawns to the raid event.
``` INI
[YourRaidName.Index]
Enabled=true
Name=Draugr Party Time
PrefabName=Draugr
MaxSpawned=500
... additional configuration
```

Repeat step 2, for additional spawns in the same raid event. Just make sure to increase the index every time.

For multiple raids, repeat from step 1.

## Supplemental raid file "custom_raids.supplemental.my_raid_name.cfg"

Exactly as for the main raid file. This is simply to allow for easy splitting into multiple files, and for others to easily add new raids to Custom Raids.

## Just disable the trolls please

Just add the below to "custom_raids.raids.cfg". OverrideExisting is on by default.

``` INI
[foresttrolls]
Name=foresttrolls
Enabled=false
```

## Tips for configuring

Raid events are generally a bit "janky" to configure, so I suggest making use of the "RemoveAllExistingRaids" and "LoadRaidConfigsOnWorldStart"option from the general config. 
Enabling only your own change, and use console commands "randomevent" and "stopevent" to test things out.

Spawning during also seems to be very inconsistent, meaning with the same interval setting, you will sometimes have a bunch of wave triggers inside a short span, and sometimes it takes ages.

Biomes were a big annoyance to me during testing. To just "make it work", ensure that biome is set to 0 (everything).

ForcedEnvironment also seems to be taken more as a hint, than something forced. It should trigger most of the time though.

## Configuration Options

### Biome flags:
Biomes are registered as binary flags in valheim, meaning they each have a specific bit of a number, which is checked for true or false.
This means to allow for both Meadows (value 1, position 1) and Blackforest (value 8, position 4), the biome flag should be 9 (binary value 1001);
Just use 0 (biomes none) if you are uncertain. That enables all biomes.

### Biomes (Name, Value, Position)
- None, 0, 0
- Meadows, 1, 1
- Swamp, 2, 2,
- Mountain, 4, 3
- Blackforest, 8, 4
- Plains, 16, 5
- AshLands, 32, 6
- DeepNorth, 64, 7
- Ocean, 256, 8
- Mistlands, 512, 9
- BiomesMax, 513

### BiomeArea (Name, Value, Position)
As with biome flags. Use 3 for all.

- Edge, 1, 0,
- Median, 2, 1,
- Everything, 3

### ForcedEnvironment (defaults, it should be possible to mod in more, and refer to them by name):
- Clear
- Twilight_Clear
- Misty
- Darklands_dark
- Heath clear
- DeepForest Mist
- GDKing
- Rain
- LightRain
